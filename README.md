# Cubic
Cubic is a 3D voxel-based game. Cubic-Go is the Go port. It's mostly a toy project for the time being.

## Build Environment
To build, you'll need to have Go installed (1.6+ recommended). You'll also need GCC on the path (with matching
architecture to the Go install).

On Debian-based systems, you'll also need some additional prerequisite packages for compiling `go-gl`. See `prereqs.sh`
for more information, or just run it as `sudo` or `root` to install them automatically.
